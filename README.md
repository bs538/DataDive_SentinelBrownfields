# DataDive_SentinelBrownfields
Exploratory analysis for Urban Analytics Data Dive: Identifying sites for the construction of new homes from satellite data.

### Key Ideas:
- Brownfields (disused industrial sites) are good candidates for building new homes within a city.
- There is a pilot sample of these sites in the Greater Manchester area (information collected on the ground).
- Using Sentinel-2 satellite images, we can measure the characteristic "spectrum" of these sites, and check if it differs from other areas in an urban environment.
- This information can then be used as an input to train a classification algorithm.
